### Flexbox

**Review: Flexbox**

You should be proud of yourself! You have learned the most important properties of flexbox. Flexbox is an art and a science; you can use it to make laying out multiple elements a piece of cake. You know everything necessary to begin using it in your own projects.

1. display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
2. display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
3. justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.
4. align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.

flex-grow
 is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.

flex-shrink
 is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.

flex-basis
 is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.
flex is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration.

flex-wrap
 specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.
align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis.

flex-flow
 is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.
Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring display: flex or display: inline-flex for children of flex containers.

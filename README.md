### Flexbox

**Review: Flexbox**

You should be proud of yourself! You have learned the most important properties of flexbox. Flexbox is an art and a science; you can use it to make laying out multiple elements a piece of cake. You know everything necessary to begin using it in your own projects.

1. display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
2. display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
3. justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.
4. align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.
